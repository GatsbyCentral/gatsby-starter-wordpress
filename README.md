# Gatsby v2 WordPress Starter

**NOTE:** This is the Gatsby v2 WordPress starter. It is a work in progress.

This starter is forked from the
[gatsby-starter-netlify-cms](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms)
and modified to use WordPress instead of netlify-cms.

Demo: https://gatsby-v2-starter-wordpress.netlify.com/
